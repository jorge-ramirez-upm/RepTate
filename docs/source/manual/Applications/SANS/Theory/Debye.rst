Description
-----------
      
This theory accounts for the small angle neutron scattering from melts of ideal Gaussian chains. It is intended to simultaneously fit quiescent scattering data for monodisperse linear polymers, for several molecular weights. The theory uses a set of molecular parameters which can be obtained from the literature, or can be fitted to data if unavailable elsewhere. For full details of the background theory see :cite:`SANS-Higgins_1994`; for an example of its application see :cite:`SANS-Graham_2006`; for details about the effect of non-ideal mixing, see :cite:`SANS-deGennes_1979`.
