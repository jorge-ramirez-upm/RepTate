  abstract = {Numerical flow simulations play an important role in polymer processing. One of the essential prerequisites for accurate and precise flow simulations is to obtain accurate materials functions. In the framework of the generalized Newtonian fluid model, one needs to obtain shear viscosity as a function of the rate-of-shear and temperature{\textemdash}as determined by rheometry{\textemdash}and then fitted to a mathematical model. Often, many subjectively perform the fitting without paying attention to the relative quality of the estimated parameters. This paper proposes a unique iterative algorithm for fitting the rate-of-shear and temperature-dependent viscosity model under the time{\textendash}temperature superposition (TTS) principle. Proof-of-concept demonstrations are shown using the five-parameter Carreau{\textendash}Yasuda model and experimental data from small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) measurements. It is shown that the newly proposed iterative algorithm leads to a more accurate representation of the experimental data compared to the traditional approach. We compare their performance in studies of the steady isothermal flow of a Carreau{\textendash}Yasuda model fluid in a straight, circular tube. The two sets of parameters, one from the traditional approach and the other from the newly proposed iterative approach, show considerable differences in flow simulation. The percentage difference between the two predictions can be as large as 10\% or more. Furthermore, even in cases where prior knowledge of the TTS shifting factors is not available, the newly proposed iterative approach can still yield a good fit to the experimental data, resulting in both the shifting factors and parameters for the non-Newtonian fluid model.},

  abstract = {We have measured the dynamics of completely monodisperse (PDI = 1.0) ultrahigh-molecular-weight linear lambda ({$\lambda$}) DNA solutions as a function of concentration. Due to the very high molecular weight of the DNA, Mn = Mw {$>$} 30 million g/mol, we were able to study the dynamic properties of well-entangled systems even in very dilute (low-concentration) conditions. We report the linear rheology by conducting dynamic oscillatory measurements well into the entanglement regime (11 {$<$} C* {$<$} 90), where C* is the overlap concentration. The tests are reported in good solvent conditions. Upon comparing our results with previously reported data in the literature by Teixeira et al. [Macromolecules 2007, 40 (7), 2461-2476] and reproducing their data, we can confirm their measurements to have been conducted in the nonlinear regime. This leads to the conclusion that the lambda DNA exhibits extreme strain sensitivity in the observed dynamics, and this induces the earlier onset of nonlinearity as the angular frequency decreases. The time-concentration superposition (TCS) was found to be valid in the terminal zone, which permitted the evaluation of {$\sim$}9 decades of dynamics in the mastercurve. The concentration dependence of the time- concentration shift factors (vertical and horizontal) was found to be in good agreement with the plateau moduli and the crossover frequency scaling. A concentration dependence of plateau modulus GN0 {$\sim$} C2.29 is obtained from the dynamic tests. The plateau modulus scaling is consistent with the blob model for entangled polymer solutions. The terminal relaxation time shows a change like the unentangled-to-entangled crossover in synthetic polymer solutions from {$\tau$}d {$\sim$} C1.1 and {$\tau$}d {$\sim$} C3.53 at around 1 mg/mL (24C*). A very high concentration dependence of the zero-shear viscosity, {$\eta$}0 {$\sim$} C5.5, is estimated for the high-concentration samples. We interpret the concentration-dependent scaling to be in an entangled regime observed only in very high molecular weight solutions at sufficiently high concentrations. A Likhtman-McLeish model was used to fit the LVE with the constraint release parameter, c{$\nu$}, fixed at 1 and 10. The Likhtman-McLeish model does not seem to capture all of the physical processes in the dynamics, and a good fit was not obtained, particularly for the higher-concentration samples though the fit quality improved with the greater constraint release parameter magnitude. Entanglement density predicted by the Likhtman-McLeish model scaled linearly with the entanglement density calculated by the blob model for solutions. The entangled dynamics is possibly nonreptative as reptation or its derivative models do not predict the observed strong nonlinearity and the high susceptibility of the system to strain.},

Long-term creep properties obtained through the time-temperature superposition showed superior creep resistance of composites with NPP matrix. In part, this is attributed to their higher crystallinity and better interfacial adhesion caused by the formation of a transcrystalline layer. This difference resulted in up to 25\% creep compliance reduction of composites with NPP matrix compared to composites with recycled (RPP) polypropylene matrix, which does not form a transcrystalline layer between the fibers and polymer matrix. Despite the overall inferior creep performance of composites with RPP matrix, from the 20 wt.\% on, the creep compliance is comparable and even surpasses the creep performance of unfilled NPP matrix and can be a promising way to promote sustainability.},

This work studies how the printing conditions employed in fuse filament fabrication (FFF) affect the properties of poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxy hexanoate) or PHBH. Firstly, rheological results predicted the printability of PHBH, which was successfully realized. Unlike what usually happens in FFF manufacturing or several semi-crystalline polymers, it was observed that the crystallization of PHBH occurs isothermally after deposition on the bed and not during the non-isothermal cooling stage, according to calorimetric measurements. A computational simulation of the temperature profile during the printing process was conducted to confirm this behavior, and the results support this hypothesis. Through the analysis of mechanical properties, it was shown that the nozzle and bed temperature increase improved the mechanical properties, reducing the void formation and improving interlayer adhesion, as shown by SEM. Intermediate printing velocities produced the best mechanical properties.},

The compatibility of the blend is examined with differential scanning calorimetry and thermal gravimetry analysis. In the range of concentration of Dertoline, from 5 to 15\,wt\%, a cold crystallization peak first shifts to slightly higher then lower temperature. Dynamical mechanical analysis and tensile tests confirm that the addition of Dertoline slightly decreases the elastic modulus. The degree of crystallinity again increases then decreases with the content of Dertoline. Polarized light microscopy reveals smaller diameter spherulites for PHB/Dertoline blends and their presence is discussed in relation to tensile tests. Overall, the addition of Dertoline has limited effects on mechanical properties of the blends: the stress at break and the strain at break. In addition, oscillatory rheology at different temperatures provides the activation energies and the parameters of a generalized Maxwell model. The temperature dependence of the rheological properties follows an Arrhenius form. Finally, transient step viscosity measurements are used in order to quantify the PHB thermal degradation.},

Here a chiral acyl-semicarbazide gelator forms three different gels of contrasting fibre morphology (termed `gelmorphs') as well as lyotropic liquid crystalline droplets depending on the assembly pathway. The gels have morphologies that are either hyperhelical (HH-Gel), tape-fibre (TF-Gel) or thin fibril derived from the liquid crystalline phase (LC-Gels) and exhibit very different rheological properties. The gelator exists as three slowly interconverting conformers in solution. All three gels are comprised of an unsymmetrical, intramolecular hydrogen bonded conformer. The kinetics show that formation of the remarkable HH-Gel is cooperative and is postulated to involve association of the growing fibril with a non-gelling conformer. This single molecule dynamic conformational library shows how very different materials with different morphology and hence very contrasting materials properties can arise from pathway complexity as a result of emergent interactions during the assembly process.},

  abstract = {Fused filament fabrication (FFF), a form of filament-based material extrusion additive manufacturing (AM), is an extremely useful technique for the rapid production of highly customized products; however, empirical evidence is heavily relied upon for understanding of the process. Initial modeling attempts have traditionally focused on predicting heat transfer and either interlayer diffusion and adhesion or stress development but have not taken a combined approach to analyze all three components simultaneously in a multiphysics model. In this study, we implement finite difference models to examine the combined heat transfer, polymer diffusion represented as degree of healing (Dh), and residual stress development in FFF of poly(ether imide) (PEI). Printing with PEI is of great interest because of its desirable mechanical properties and high use temperatures, but it also creates a more challenging modeling problem with higher thermal gradients and greater potential thermal processing window compared to traditionally modeled AM materials, such as acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). The larger processing window can potentially allow for more processing options but can also significantly complicate the optimization process. In this study, experimental analyses including trouser tear tests and part warpage measurements provide correlation to predicted Dh and stress levels. The models suggest that the temperature of a layer is influenced by the subsequent printing of up to at least three layers in the geometry studied. The results of this study further demonstrate the sensitivity of the molecular mobility and degree of healing to the reptation time ({$\tau$}rep), such that a small change in the {$\tau$}rep on the order of 2{\textendash}3x can result in an order of magnitude difference in the time before interfacial healing can begin, culminating in significantly less healing occurring. Furthermore, the reptation time and subsequent healing predictions are highly reliant on the extrapolation method used to extend the reptation time to temperatures below those at which it was measured resulting in significantly different predictive results, even if the same experimental data is used.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale simulations of two (cross-linking vs noncross-linking) representative polymer-elastomer (Nylon 6/ACM) blends are performed without introducing freely adjustable parameters. The simulation allows for a direct investigation into the interplay between flow history (modeled herein by oscillatory shear flow), blend morphology, and viscoelasticity of the polymer composite. Detailed spectral analysis is utilized to resolve the stress relaxations in the bulk and interface regions, respectively, in an effort to gain insight into the origins of blend elasticity. The results reveal a notable impact of flow history on the blend morphology, and the substantially altered storage modulus response in the terminal regime agrees well with early experimental observations on a broad variety of immiscible polymer blends. The interfacial relaxation, in particular, is found to formally commence when the stress relaxations of individual polymer components in the bulk phase are nearly complete, helping to release the remaining stress that was previously dictated by repulsion-driven tube dilations{\dbend} instead of chain reptation{\dbend}in the interface region. Importantly, the last feature suggests that the bulk and interfacial relaxations of a polymer blend cannot be fully decoupled. Cross-linking between the elastomers (ACM) adds further complexity to the features of storage modulus response while partly offsetting the flow-induced phase separation. The generality of the simulation protocols described herein along with the affordable computational expense is expected to greatly facilitate future processing designs on polymer-polymer and polymer-elastomer blends.},

The Monte Carlo simulation developed by Tobita is used as the molecular structure simulation. The molecular simulation is performed assuming a five tanks-in-series model, which allows one to investigate a wide variety of reactor operations, from the condition closer to the tubular process to the autoclave processes systematically. The branched structure is quantitatively evaluated by the parameter known as priority and seniority (segment depth). The viscoelastic simulation is based on the branch-on-branch rheology (BoB-rheology) model developed by McLeish et~al. It is found that the long-chain branched structure of the molecule becomes more complicated in the autoclave process, and then, the strain hardening property of extensional viscosity becomes larger than that for the tubular process.},

  abstract = {A recently proposed hierarchical triple-scale simulation methodology (Behbahani et al., Macromolecules, 2021, 54, 2740-2762) is applied to cis-1,4 polyisoprene melts of a broad range of molecular weights, from oligomers to commercial-grade entangled materials. Dynamics are systematically probed over 12 orders of magnitude in time using a combination of atomistic and bottom-up parameterized coarse-grained and slip-spring simulations. Following calibration of the slip-spring simulations using the end-to-end autocorrelation function, generated data are contrasted to dielectric relaxation spectroscopy experiments and rheological measurements in the literature. A good agreement is found, particularly for highly entangled polymer melts, supporting the ability of the scheme to provide bottom-up parameter-free predictions on the dynamics of polymeric materials. Finally, we systematically examine the application of theoretical models to our strictly monodisperse cis-1,4 polyisoprene melts and provide estimates of the phenomenological parameters employed.},

  abstract = {Tassieri et al. have introduced a novel rheological tool called ``i-Rheo GT'' that allows the evaluation of the frequency-dependent materials' linear viscoelastic properties from a direct Fourier transform of the time-dependent relaxation modulus G(t), without artifacts. They adopted i-Rheo GT to exploit the information embedded in G(t) derived from molecular dynamics simulations of atomistic and quasi-atomistic models, and they estimated the polymers' entanglement characteristic time ({$\tau$}e) from the crossover point of the moduli at intermediate times, which had never been possible before because of the poor fitting performance, at short time scales, of the commonly used generalized Maxwell models. Here, we highlight that the values of {$\tau$}e reported by Tassieri et al. are significantly different (i.e., an order of magnitude smaller) from those reported in the literature, obtained from either experiments or molecular dynamics simulations of different observables. In this work, we demonstrate that consistent values of {$\tau$}e can be achieved if the initial values of G(t), i.e., those governed by the bond-oscillation dynamics, are discarded. These findings have been corroborated by adopting i-Rheo GT to Fourier transform the outcomes of three different molecular dynamics simulations based on the following three models: a dissipative particle dynamics model, a Kremer{\textendash}Grest model, and an atomistic polyethylene model. Moreover, we have investigated the variations of {$\tau$}e as function of (i) the `cadence' at which G(t) is evaluated, (ii) the spring constant of the atomic bone, and (iii) the initial value of the shear relaxation modulus G(O). The ensemble of these results confirms the effectiveness of i-Rheo GT and provide new insights into the interpretation of molecular dynamics simulations for a better understanding of polymer dynamics.},

The irregular structure of carbon chains in dimer fatty acids leads to the amorphous nature of FPIs. The effect of imine bond on the glass transition temperature of FPIs is studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The linear viscoelasticity of FPIs is investigated by small amplitude oscillatory shear tests and analyzed by using the Likhtman-McLeish theory. It is found that the rheological behavior of FPIs is similar with that of static, linear entangled polymers predicted by Likhtman-McLeish theory, when the dynamic chain arrangements caused by imine-bond exchange is not active enough. For FPIs, the temperature variation of viscosity is still following the Arrhenius law with an activation energy of {\textasciitilde}50\,kJ\,mol               -1               .

In this study, we analyzed the elongational viscosity of poly (propylene carbonate) (PPC) melts in terms of monomeric friction via primitive chain network simulations. By incorporating a small polydispersity of materials, the linear viscoelastic response was semi-quantitatively reproduced. Owing to this agreement, we determined units of time and modulus to carry out elongational simulations. The simulation with constant monomeric friction overestimated elongational viscosity, whereas it nicely captured the experimental data if friction decreased with increasing segment orientation. To see the effect of chemistry, we also conducted the simulation for a polystyrene (PS) melt, which has a similar entanglement number per chain and a polydispersity index. The results imply that PPC and PS behave similarly in terms of the reduction of friction under fast deformations.},

Before analysis, the simulation was evaluated against literature data for linear polyisoprene melts, and quantitative agreement was obtained for viscoelastic and dielectric relaxations. Afterward, the end-to-end relaxation function was compared to survival probability of the slip link {$\varphi$}s(t) and the ratio of monomers between the most distant surviving slip link pair to the total number of monomers ns(t)/nt. The result implies that ns(t)/nt is comparable to {$\varphi$}'(t). Comparison to atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for polyethylene showed similar results, implying that {$\varphi$}'(t) can be obtained even in MD simulations if the surviving entanglement points can be specified.},

To elucidate the nature and consequence of entanglements in dense polymer solutions, we propose a novel method: a ``dynamical entanglement analysis'' (DEA) to extract spatiotemporal entanglement structures from the pairwise displacement correlation of entangled chains. By applying this method to large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of linear and unknotted, nonconcatenated ring polymers, we find a strong and unexpected cooperative dynamics: the footprint of mutual entrainment between entangled chains. We show that DEA is a powerful and sensitive probe that reveals previously unnoticed and architecture-dependent spatiotemporal structures of dynamical entanglement in polymeric solutions. We also propose a mean-field approximation of our analysis that provides previously under-appreciated physical insights into the dynamics of generic entangled polymers. We envisage DEA will be useful to analyze the dynamical evolution of entanglements in generic polymeric systems such as blends and composites.},

  abstract = {Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a thermoplastic semi-crystalline polymer, with many outstanding properties such as excellent resistance to corrosion, excellent temperature stability, very high electrical insulation and extremely low friction coefficient. These make it suitable for a large range of engineering applications ; one of them is the manufacturing of PTFE films and coated fabrics.Due to their high molecular weight and their high viscosity in the melted state, PTFE thin films are obtained by successive deposition of dispersions on a substrate which is finally peeled out. Composite materials are manufactured by welding together a fabric sandwiched between two such PTFE films. Therefore, for optimum performance, PTFE-PTFE and PTFE-fabric adhesion must be controlled.This work focuses on a model system: two PTFE films without fabrics. The aim is to quantify the adhesion mechanisms and optimize films welding. A specific experimental setup has been designed to weld PTFE films and perform mechanical adherence tack tests investigating the impact of temperature, contact time and normal pressure on the interfacial adhesive properties. The role of chain interdiffusion in the amorphous phase and/or co-crystallization of the polymer quasi-crystalline phase in the adhesion is investigated.A contact temperature higher than melting, allowing macromolecular chain or segments mobility, is highlighted as a necessary condition to obtain adhesion. Increasing the contact time shows no significant variation. Above melting, different failure mechanisms are observed according to the contact pressure: the weld fracture is either destructive or not. A threshold pressure exists between these two fracture modes: the longer contact time, the lower the threshold pressure. A model based on a three dimensions discrete network is proposed to obtain an estimation of the characteristic adhesive energetic value.},

  abstract = {Interfacial rheology is crucial in dictating morphology and ultimate properties of particle-stabilized polymer blends, but is challenging to be determined. In this study, a fully polymeric dumbbell-shaped Janus nanoparticle (JNP) of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS) spheres with equal sizes ({$\sim$}80 nm) was prepared and used as an efficient compatibilizer for PMMA/PS blends. The JNPs were preferentially localized at the PMMA/PS interface, thereby reducing the interfacial tension and refining the morphology in both droplet-matrix and co-continuous type blends, whereby a JNP concentration {$\sim$}2.5 wt \% is sufficient to reach a saturation in droplet size reduction due to compatibilization. Based on the linear viscoelastic moduli and corresponding relaxation spectra (H({$\tau$})*{$\tau$}) of JNP-compatibilized droplet-matrix blends, besides the droplet shape relaxation time ({$\tau$}F), a longer relaxation time ({$\tau\beta$}), typically related to interfacial viscoelasticity, was readily identified. The dependence of {$\tau\beta$} on the JNP concentration (WJNPs) was significantly dominated by the droplet size reduction induced by the JNP compatibilization, with {$\tau\beta$} decreasing with increasing WJNPs. The viscoelastic properties extracted from {$\tau\beta$} typically originate from a combination of gradients in interfacial tension due to the particle redistribution at the droplet interface (Marangoni stresses) and the deviatoric stresses of intrinsic rheological origin. The latter originate from the intrinsic viscoelasticity of the particle-laden interface, which is enhanced by particle jamming and particle-polymer interactions, such as entanglements between chains from the polymeric spheres and those penetrating from the bulk into the spheres. To address the challenge of isolating these contributions, a JNP-sandwiched PMMA/PS multilayer structure was designed to exclude the effect of Marangoni stresses and droplet curvature, thus having no {$\tau$}F but a new relaxation ({$\tau{'}\beta$}), which characterizes the contribution of intrinsic interfacial viscoelasticity. The {$\tau{'}\beta$} was observed to increase with JNP coverage ({$\Sigma$}) following the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann model that is typically used to describe the divergent behavior of the ``cage'' effect in classical colloidal glasses. Moreover, a multimode Maxwell model fitting allows to split the interfacial relaxation into the confined diffusion of JNPs within their cage and the entanglements between the JNPs and the bulk.},

  abstract = {Sodium-ion batteries are a prospective sustainable alternative to the ubiquitous lithium-ion batteries due to the abundancy of sodium, and their cobalt free cathodes. The high nickel O3-type oxides show promising energy densities, however, a time dependency in the rheological properties of the composite electrode slurries is observed, which leads to inhomogeneous coatings being produced. A combination of electron microscopy and infra-red spectroscopy were used to monitor the O3-oxide surface changes upon exposure to air, and the effect upon the rheology and stability of the inks was investigated. Upon exposure to air, NaOH rather than Na2CO3 was observed on the surfaces of the powder through FTIR and EDS. The subsequent gelation of the slurry was initiated by the NaOH and dehydrofluorination with crosslinking of PVDF was observed through the reaction product, NaF. Approximately 15\% of the CF bonds in PVDF undergo this dehydrofluorination to form NaF. As observed in the relaxation time of fitted rheological data, the gelation undergoes a three-stage process: a dehydrofluorination stage, creating saturated structures, a crosslinking stage, resulting in the highest rate of gelation, and a final crosslinking stage. This work shows the mechanism for instability of high nickel containing powders and electrode slurries, and presents a new time dependent oscillatory rheology test that can be used to determine the process window for these unstable slurry systems.},

  abstract = {Vehicle sound package has a substantial role in attenuation of vehicle noise for the purpose of improving interior comfort and reducing environmental noise pollution. In this paper, two approaches of absorptive design and multi-layer design are investigated to improve the performance of a sound package in automotive applications. For this purpose, the sound package of the engine compartment including hoodliner and dash insulator is studied. Furthermore, this paper proposes an experimentally validated prediction model through Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) to evaluate the sound insulation of a vehicle body sound package. For this purpose, the research includes characterization techniques of sound package materials to determine intrinsic parameters of different layers required to develop a reliable SEA model. The inverse method and time-temperature superposition principle (TTSP) are utilized to characterize porous materials and heavy layer properties, respectively. The comparison of results that are experimentally obtained by acoustic cabin shows a fairly well agreement with the proposed SEA modeling procedure for the desired frequency range. By observing the results of the simulation for the hoodliner and dash insulator, it was revealed that the absorptive design combines the benefits of high sound absorption capability, wide absorption frequency band, and lightweight. Indeed, with an appropriate combination of layers, the multi-layer design can simultaneously provide a mixture of absorptive design attributes and sound insulation capabilities. The transmission loss obtained from the proposed design of the dash insulator revealed an increase by 42\% without any reduction in the amount of sound absorption. Also, the sound absorption of the proposed hoodliner is enhanced more than twice in reference to the base design.},

  abstract = {Silk is one of the most intriguing examples of biomolecular selfassembly, yet little is understood of molecular mechanisms behind the flow behavior generating these complex high-performance fibers. This work applies the polymer physics of entangled solution rheology to present a first microphysical understanding of silk in the linear viscoelastic regime. We show that silk solutions can be approximated as reptating polymers with ``sticky'' calcium bridges whose strength can be controlled through the potassium concentration. This approach provides a new window into critical microstructural parameters, in particular identifying the mechanism by which potassium and calcium ions are recruited as a powerful viscosity control in silk. Our model constitutes a viable starting point to understand not only the ``flow-induced self-assembly'' of silk fibers but also a broader range of phenomena in the emergent field of material-focused synthetic biology.},

  abstract = {The flow-induced self-assembly of entangled Bombyx mori silk proteins is hypothesised to be aided by the `registration' of aligned protein chains using intermolecularly interacting `sticky' patches. This suggests that upon chain alignment, a hierarchical network forms that collectively stretches and induces nucleation in a precisely controlled way. Through the lens of polymer physics, we argue that if all chains would stretch to a similar extent, a clear correlation length of the stickers in the direction of the flow emerges, which may indeed favour such a registration effect. Through simulations in both extensional flow and shear, we show that there is, on the other hand, a very broad distribution of protein{\textendash}chain stretch, which suggests the registration of proteins is not directly coupled to the applied strain, but may be a slow statistical process. This qualitative prediction seems to be consistent with the large strains (i.e., at long time scales) required to induce gelation in our rheological measurements under constant shear. We discuss our perspective of how the flow-induced self-assembly of silk may be addressed by new experiments and model development.},

  abstract = {A full inspection of the motion and relaxation of soft matter systems, such as polymer melts, solutions, and networks, spans from the quantum mechanical derivation of bond fluctuations to the macroscopic viscous modes of rubbers. The simulation of all properties at once is impossible, and crucial simplifications have to be made. For example, atoms can be viewed as rigid objects, and multiple atoms, monomers, or chain segments can be displayed by a single "bead". A generic polymer chain, stripped of its chemical details, might be modeled by a number of beads that are connected by springs, in a so-called coarse-grained, mesoscale description. This mesoscale chain does no longer obey all physical laws of its more detailed parent model, and they must be reintroduced as artifacts from a different scale. One of the multiscale methods capable of doing so is the slip-spring dissipative-particle-dynamics method presented here. Dissipative particle dynamics is a mesoscale method that allows a description of polymers by a simple bead-and-spring model. The interactions of beads are repulsive and soft, so that multiple beads can occupy the same point in space, and chains can pass through each other. In a real system, a polymer chain in a melt can be imagined as being confined in a tube by its neighboring chains. Its translational degrees of freedom are reduced to a creeping, "reptating" motion along its main axis. In regular dissipative-particle-dynamics simulations, this behavior is no longer obeyed, and the chain can escape its tube in a lateral motion. Restoring the correct physics means to confine this motion, which is done by slip springs, that is, artificial, mobile bonds that travel along the chain by their own dynamics. The slip-spring dissipative-particle-dynamics method has been proposed some years ago and was successfully applied to study polymer melts and solutions. Here, it is extended to further systems where a crucial role of topological interactions is anticipated. By correctly applying the slip-spring dissipative-particle-dynamics method, the role of entanglements in these systems can be studied. A first objective is to model flash nanoprecipitation by slip-spring dissipative particle dynamics. Flash nanoprecipitation is an experimental technique to produce nanoparticles based on the rapid mixing of a polymer solution with a nonsolvent. As solvent and nonsolvent mix, polymer chains collapse, and the polymer solution precipitates. Here, two studies are presented that investigate the collapse pathway of a single, isolated chain, and the precipitation of a polymer solution. In the first study, a single, long chain is quenched from solvent into nonsolvent conditions. The collapse pathway exhibits three stages: first, the chain collapses into blobs along its backbone, which are initially connected by bridges of slack polymer. Second, the bridges are absorbed by the blobs, until the chain resembles a pearl necklace. Third, the so-far undeformed chain backbone collapses. For each of the collapse stages, a characteristic scaling with the chain length is identified. Both the collapse pathway as well as the scaling are in excellent agreement with a theoretical model, and discrepancies can be readily explained by the mergence of different dissipative mechanisms. In the case of precipitating polymer solutions, the collapsing chains interact with each other and form a network-like structure, where blobs are spanned by highly stretched chains. The study's working hypothesis is that the stability of this intermediate structure would be altered by varying numbers of slip springs if topological interactions played a role. However, no influence of slip springs is found, and the intermediate network structure quickly dissolves into spatially separated nanoparticles. In a third study, the slip-spring dissipative-particle-dynamics method is extended to study the topological interactions of elastomers. In these network structures, slip springs successfully recover the topological effects of neighboring network strands. The resulting change in the entanglement contribution to the shear modulus of the inspected networks is in excellent agreement with reference simulations. Moreover, the dynamic storage- and loss moduli of experimental polyisoprene rubbers can be predicted by cross-linking a polymer melt mapped onto polyisoprene. The successful extension of the slip-spring dissipative-particle-dynamics method to networks will allow future investigations of systems of scientific and industrial interest, such as network defects and filled elastomers.},

  abstract = {We study elastomeric networks using dissipativeparticle-dynamics simulations. This soft-core method gives access to mesoscopic time and length scales and is potentially capable to study complex systems such as network defects and gels, but the unmodified method underestimates topological interactions and can only model phantom networks. In this work, we study the capability of slip springs to recover topological effects of network strands. We show that slip springs with a restricted mobility restore the topological contributions of trapped entanglements. Uniaxial strain experiments give access to the cross-link and entanglement contribution to the shear modulus of a slip-spring model network. We find these contributions to coincide with those reported for comparable hard-core Kremer-Grest networks (Gula et al. Macromolecules 2020, 53, 6907-6927). For network strands longer than the chains' entanglement length, the contribution of slip springs to the shear modulus equals the plateau modulus of the un-crosslinked precursor melt. However, a constant number of slip springs overestimates the shear modulus for high cross-link densities. To probe their applicability, we successfully compare our simulations with experimental polyisoprene rubbers: a network obtained by parameter-free cross-linking of a simulated polyisoprene melt reproduces the viscoelastic moduli of experimental rubbers.},

  abstract = {Piezoelectric poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) fibers, exhibiting high molecular chain orientation, are promising for biomedical applications. Chain orientation decreases due to fast relaxation during melt{\textendash}spinning process, which implies that a second process to induce piezoelectric chain morphology is usually necessary. This work introduces a one{\textendash}step melt{\textendash}spinning process of piezoelectric PLLA fibers, spun directly from the melt, employing a rheological guidance for the selection of PLLA type and process parameters, based on Rouse's relaxation time. The chain orientation and the relaxation time increased with the optical purity and average molecular weight of PLLA. The reduction of extrusion temperature from 180 {\textdegree}C to 150 {\textdegree}C facilitated in a significant way the preservation of chain orientation, and the impact of the elongation rate was as well intensified. Combining high elongation rates of {$\leq$}29s{\textendash}1 and reduced extrusion temperature of 150 {\textdegree}C led to flow{\textendash}induced crystallization of oriented crystals directly from melt in a single step. This fiber exhibited piezoelectric properties in form of a deflection of 1.9{$\pm$}0.3 {\textmu}m when applying an open{\textendash}circuit voltage of 210V. The piezoelectric response was similar to that of a fiber, melt{\textendash}spun at high extrusion temperature of 180{\textdegree}C, with additional post-annealing in a second step.},

One potential source of loss of liquid-like properties during ageing of RNA-binding protein condensates is the progressive formation of inter-protein               {$\beta$}               -sheets. To bridge microscopic understanding between accumulation of inter-protein               {$\beta$}               -sheets over time and the modulation of FUS and hnRNPA1 condensate viscoelasticity, we develop a multiscale simulation approach. Our method integrates atomistic simulations with sequence-dependent coarse-grained modelling of condensates that exhibit accumulation of inter-protein               {$\beta$}               -sheets over time. We reveal that inter-protein               {$\beta$}               -sheets notably increase condensate viscosity but does not transform the phase diagrams. Strikingly, the network of molecular connections within condensates is drastically altered, culminating in gelation when the network of strong               {$\beta$}               -sheets fully percolates. However, high concentrations of RNA decelerate the emergence of inter-protein               {$\beta$}               -sheets. Our study uncovers molecular and kinetic factors explaining how the accumulation of inter-protein               {$\beta$}               -sheets can trigger liquid-to-solid transitions in condensates, and suggests a potential mechanism to slow such transitions down.},

  abstract = {To understand the effect of chemical composition, cross-link density, and microstructure on the linear and nonlinear viscoelasticity of ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber, we carried out high-frequency oscillatory shear molecular dynamics simulations at varying shear strain rates. Sweeping through different EPDM compositions with varying ethylene, propylene, and diene ratios, a positive correlation was observed between the ratio of the propylene monomer and the complex shear modulus of EPDM in the high-frequency glassy regime. For small deformations in this regime, we found that the simplest measure of local molecular stiffness, namely, the Debye-Waller factor, is predictive of the complex shear modulus and loss modulus of 20 unique systems with distinct compositions and cross-link densities. Polymer design parameters that reduce the Debye-Waller factor, including cross-linking or increased propylene content generally, result in higher moduli. Remarkably, large-amplitude oscillatory shear simulations revealed that dissipation becomes strongly influenced by polymer entanglements, which results in divergent optimal compositions for small-strain vs large-strain applications of EPDM. Utilizing time-temperature superposition and varying strain rates in simulations, we were able to capture rheological properties over 6 orders of magnitude in frequency. The data was captured well using a Rouse model superposed with a stretched exponential function, which was used to predict key constants that determine the mechanical behavior in these regimes. Our findings establish a chemistry-specific molecular simulation approach for capturing the constitutive behavior of elastomers and pave the way for multiscale analyses linking composition and microstructure to performance.},

However, these solutions are rarely verified, specifically for complex systems with many population members and strong coupling, as is the case for industrially relevant free-radical-induced grafting (FRIG) toward graft copolymer (GC) synthesis with monomer unit dependent reactions. FRIG, as studied in the present work with polybutadiene at low styrene conversions, is an important chemical process, for example, the production of compatibilizers and high-impact materials. Deterministic model validation is uniquely performed by benchmarking the low to medium molar mass (MM) results (29 topologies) in the log-molar mass distribution with detailed matrix-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulation output, inherently capable of mapping distributions. The GC product is identified to be a heterogeneous mixture in MM, chemical composition, and molecular topology at any styrene conversion. The molecular structural evolution during GC synthesis is further theoretically related to both one-dimensional size-exclusion chromatography (1D-SEC) and two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) analysis. It is shown that conventional SEC{\textemdash}even in the absence of broadening{\textemdash}is insufficient for GC separation, mainly due to the unavoidable coelution of topologically different GC species. In any case, the parallel running of advanced modeling tools allows for detailed molecular interpretation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Dielectric spectroscopy is extremely powerful to study molecular dynamics, because of the very broad frequency range. Often multiple processes superimpose resulting in spectra that expand over several orders of magnitude, with some of the contributions partially hidden. For illustration, we selected two examples, (i) normal mode of high molar mass polymers partially hidden by conductivity and polarization and (ii) contour length fluctuations partially hidden by reptation using the well-studied polyisoprene melts as example. The intuitive approach to describe experimental spectra and to extract relaxation times is the addition of two or more model functions. Here, we use the empirical Havriliak-Negami function to illustrate the ambiguity of the extracted relaxation time, despite an excellent agreement of the fit with experimental data. We show that there are an infinite number of solutions for which a perfect description of experimental data can be achieved. However, a simple mathematical relationship indicates uniqueness of the pairs of the relaxation strength and relaxation time. Sacrificing the absolute value of the relaxation time enables to find the temperature dependence of the parameters with a high accuracy. For the specific cases studied here, the time temperature superposition (TTS) is very useful to confirm the principle. However, the derivation is not based on a specific temperature dependence, hence, independent from the TTS. We compare new and traditional approaches and find the same trend for the temperature dependence. The important advantage of the new technology is the knowledge of the accuracy of the relaxation times. Relaxation times determined from data for which the peak is clearly visible are the same within the experimental accuracy for traditional and new technology. However, for data where a dominant process hides the peak, substantial deviations can be observed. We conclude that the new approach is particularly helpful for cases in which relaxation times need to be determined without having access to the associated peak position.},
